# cpu-control

Bash script to enable/disable CPUs (cores) on a Linux machine

# Usage

Script needs to be executed as root
```
./cpu-control.sh 0.5 # enable half of installed CPUs to run
./cpu-control.sh 1 # enable all CPUs to run
```

# Example use case

1. Modify available CPU power based on daily schedule
  - Dial down available CPUs during office hours to limit heat, noise generated by computers
2. Conserve energy based on (pricing) schedule
  - If you have a long running and CPU demanding job you can limit CPUs during times when electricity is more expensive
  - And enable all CPUs when price goes down. For example limit CPU usage between 8 AM and 8 PM
